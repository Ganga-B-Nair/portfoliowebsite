🧩 Crossword Portfolio — Ganga B Nair

Welcome to my interactive Crossword-Style Portfolio Website!
This project is a creative, playful twist on traditional developer portfolios — each letter in the crossword opens a unique modal/dialog that reveals something about me, my work, or my interests.

Designed and built using HTML + CSS + JavaScript, with smooth transitions, modals, hover interactions, and Google Fonts for a stylized aesthetic.

🎨 Features
✔ Crossword Interface

A custom crossword grid where specific letters (A, C, D, F, G, I, L, R, W) are interactive.

✔ Clickable Modals

Each clickable letter opens a modal with its own editable heading and personalized content.

✔ Smooth Hover Popups

The letter D shows a tooltip on hover and opens a modal on click.

✔ Image Grids

C (Catalyst IEDC) → Grid of 4 images

R (Reading / Books) → Grid of 4 images

Both follow a responsive layout.

✔ Editable Modal Titles

Every modal heading can be edited directly within the dialog using contenteditable.

✔ Custom Fonts & Colors

Main Heading Font: Imperial Script

Body Text Font: Zen Loop

Brand Theme:

Background: #FFEDD8

Accent/Text: #583101

✔ Fully Responsive

The layout gracefully adapts to tablets and mobile screens.
